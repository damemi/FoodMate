# FoodMate
Group project for SD&amp;D by Mike Dame, Jazmine Olinger, Karl Olsen, and Bowen Nie.

	FoodMate is the solution for anyone that has roommates and eats food. The current struggle is that there is no simple way to easily divide food (and the cost thereof) among groups of people living together. FoodMate tackles this by offering groups of roommates the ability to inventory the food they currently have and track the food they need to get. By allowing users the ability to request new items to get (and vote on those requests), the person in charge of shopping for the group can make sure everyone is satisfied with their groceries. Shopping lists and receipts are automatically generated on what you want to get and what you actually buy. Integration with payment apps like Venmo makes it easy to split the cost of groceries fairly between roommates and, along with their requests and votes, ensure that everyone pays for what they want. Group shopping is made easy with Foodmate.
