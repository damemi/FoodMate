<p>FoodMate is the solution for anyone that has roommates and eats food. The current struggle is that there is no simple way to easily divide food (and the cost thereof) among groups of people living together. FoodMate tackles this by offering groups of roommates the ability to inventory the food they currently have and track the food they need to get. By allowing users the ability to request new items to get (and vote on those requests), the person in charge of shopping for the group can make sure everyone is satisfied with their groceries. Shopping lists and receipts are automatically generated on what you want to get and what you actually buy. Integration with payment apps like Venmo makes it easy to split the cost of groceries fairly between roommates and, along with their requests and votes, ensure that everyone pays for what they want. Group shopping is made easy with Foodmate.</p>

<p>-<strong>Easy inventory tracking:</strong> everyone in a group can see and edit their current stock, keeping track of what food you have and automatically generating shopping lists for foods you need.
-<strong>User food requests:</strong> everyone can make sure they get (and pay for) the food they want, with clear accounting of who requested what.
-<strong>Barcode scanning:</strong> no need to re-enter an item every time you buy it, just scan the barcode and FoodMate will remember it for you next time.</p>
